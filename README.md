# Social-Saver-IOS
The Social Saver application for my CS 2340 class built natively using objective-c.
With Social Saver, you could share online or local deals with your friends.

NOTE: This app was built before my summer internship at Possible Mobile and my most recent work at TEQ Charging. My knowledge of mobile development has changed dramatically since those two educational work experiences.
